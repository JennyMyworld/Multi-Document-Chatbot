# Multi-Document-Chatbot
This is the program for a powerful chatbot to answer questions from various documents (PDF, DOC, TXT). Iâ€™ve used LangChain, OpenAI API, and Large Language Models from Hugging Face to create a question/answer pipeline, and employed Streamlit for crafting a user-friendly web interface.
